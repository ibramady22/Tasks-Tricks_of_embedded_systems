# Embedded Systems Tasks

This repository focuses on evaluating different tasks related to the performance, memory usage, and precision for embedded systems. Each task compares two or more methods for solving a specific problem.

## Task 1: Performance in Using Lookup Tables vs. math.h with Floating-Point

### 1. Using a Lookup Table

A lookup table is a predefined array where results for a range of mathematical inputs (e.g., sin(x), log(x)) are stored. Instead of calculating values in real-time, the program fetches them from the table.

#### Advantages:
- **Speed**: Fetching values from memory is much faster than performing calculations.
- **Predictability**: Constant retrieval time, crucial for real-time systems.
- **No FPU Dependency**: AVR microcontrollers like the ATmega32 lack hardware floating-point units, making this method more efficient.
- **Low CPU Usage**: Minimal CPU cycles are consumed.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Memory Usage**: Large lookup tables can consume a significant amount of memory.
- **Limited Precision**: You must balance precision and memory.
- **Less Flexibility**: Predefined tables can handle only specific operations.

### 2. Using math.h and Floating-Point Operations

The C Standard Library (math.h) offers functions like sin(), cos(), and pow() that compute operations at runtime using floating-point arithmetic.

#### Advantages:
- **High Precision**: Functions like sin() and cos() provide high precision results.
- **Flexibility**: Dynamically handle a wide range of inputs and complex calculations.
- **Minimal Memory Usage**: No need for large arrays.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Speed**: Floating-point operations are slower, especially without an FPU.
- **CPU Usage**: High CPU usage due to computationally expensive floating-point calculations.

### Practical Results

   - For 1000 iterations of calculating sin(45째), the command took **162 tick_time** by reading timer_reg before and after.
   - [SINE_LUT_program.c](APP/SINE_LUT_program.c).
   - [SINE_LUT_interface.h](APP/SINE_LUT_interface.h)

2. **Using math.h**:
   - For 1000 iterations of calculating sin(45째), the command took **244 tick_time** by reading timer_reg before and after.
   - The same timing technique by generating signal on pin and receive it on Oscilloscope (high signal before, low signal after) yielded these results.

## Task 2: Using Fixed-Point Math for Floating-Point Operations

In this task, we use fixed-point math to handle floating-point operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Fixed-point arithmetic offers several advantages in terms of speed, memory usage, and predictability, particularly in systems where floating-point units (FPUs) are not available.

### 1. Using Fixed-Point Math

Fixed-point math uses integers to represent real numbers by scaling the values. Typically, a **Q16.16** or **Q8.8** format is used, where part of the integer is reserved for the fractional value. 

- **Scale**: A shift factor like 2^16 (for Q16.16) is applied to real numbers to convert them to fixed-point.
- **Shift**: For operations like multiplication, a right shift is required to avoid overflow, and during division, a left shift is done to maintain precision.

This method is faster and more memory-efficient than floating-point arithmetic on systems like the ATmega32, which lack hardware FPUs.

The following operations have been implemented using fixed-point math:
- **Addition**: Add_fixed_point()
- **Subtraction**: Sub_fixed_point()
- **Multiplication**: mul_fixed_point()
- **Division**: div_fixed_point()

#### Code Implementation:
- [FixedPoint_program.c](APP/FixedPoint_program.c)
- [FixedPoint_interface.h](APP/FixedPoint_interface.h)

### 2. Advantages of Fixed-Point Math

#### Advantages:
- **Speed**: Fixed-point operations are significantly faster than floating-point because they involve integer arithmetic rather than complex floating-point calculations.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Fixed-point operations use less memory compared to floating-point, as no floating-point libraries or large variables are needed.
- **Deterministic Timing**: Fixed-point operations have constant and predictable execution times, which is essential in real-time systems.
- **No FPU Required**: Embedded systems like the ATmega32 do not have hardware FPUs, making floating-point operations computationally expensive. Fixed-point math eliminates the need for an FPU.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Lower Precision**: Compared to floating-point arithmetic, fixed-point offers lower precision, especially when dealing with numbers with many decimal places.
- **Manual Scaling**: Fixed-point math requires manual scaling and can be prone to overflow/underflow issues if not carefully managed, particularly in multiplication and division operations.

## Task 3: Design a Simple Event-Based System Using AVR Microcontroller

In an event-based system using an AVR microcontroller (MCU), the MCU reacts to external or internal events, triggering actions only when those events occur.

### 1. Button Press Event (External)

The MCU waits for a button press (an event) and reacts by toggling an LED.

#### Components:
- Atmega32 MCU
- Push button
- LED

#### Steps:
- **Event Source**: Button press (connected to an external interrupt pin, e.g., INT0).
- **Event Handler**: ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) toggles the LED.

### 2. Timer Event (Internal)

The MCU toggles the LED every 3 seconds using a timer (timer1 overflow event).

#### Components:
- Atmega32 MCU
- LED

#### Steps:
- **Event Source**: Timer overflow (Timer1) and implemented some services functions to get interrupt after (n)ms.
  - [Timers_Services.c](SERVICE/Timers_Services.c)
- **Event Handler**: Timer1_OVF_ISR toggles the LED.

---

The event-based system could be extended to handle additional events such as:

### *. UART Data Reception Event

When the MCU receives data via UART (serial communication), an ISR is triggered, and the MCU processes the incoming data and takes action based on a certain message.

### *. ADC Conversion Complete Event

When the ADC completes an analog-to-digital conversion, the MCU reads the converted value and processes it, taking action when a certain voltage value is reached. This method is commonly used with sensors in environmental control systems, such as turning on a fan when the temperature exceeds a certain threshold.


### 3. Event-Based System on AVR Using Event Loop

This project demonstrates a simple event-based system on an AVR microcontroller using an event loop to handle multiple events and actions. The system consists of 4 buttons (events) and 4 LEDs (actions), with timer interrupts used to periodically update the event queue.

#### Key Components

- **Event Queue**: A queue implemented as an array to store pending events.
- **Event Loop**: Continuously processes events from the queue and triggers corresponding actions.
- **Timer Interrupt**: A timer interrupt periodically polls the buttons (key polling) and adds events to the queue.
- **Event Handling**: Functions to handle each event, such as toggling LEDs or triggering other actions.

#### System Design

 *Figure 5: Diagram for multi_base_system architecture and its simulation on proteus.*

##### Main Loop:
- The main loop continuously processes events from the event queue. It fetches events, identifies the type of event (which button was pressed), and triggers the appropriate action (toggle corresponding LED).

##### Timer Interrupt:
- A timer interrupt is set up to periodically poll the buttons. If a button is pressed, the event is added to the queue for processing in the main loop.

##### Event Queue:
- The event queue is implemented as a circular array. Each button press generates a unique event, which is stored in the queue for the event loop to process.

#### Code Implementation:
- [Event_Based_program.c](APP/Event_Based_program.c)
- [Event_Based_interface.h](APP/Event_Based_interface.h)

## Task 4: Stack-Based State Machine Traffic Light Controller on AVR

State machines are a fundamental design pattern used to manage a system's behavior based on its current state and inputs. In this task, we implement a **traffic light controller** using a **stack-based state machine** on an AVR microcontroller. This approach offers several advantages for embedded systems that require predictable, organized transitions between various states.

### Why Use a State Machine?

A **state machine** provides a structured way to model systems that can exist in multiple states, where transitions between states occur based on specific events or conditions. By organizing the system behavior around states, we achieve:
- **Predictability**: Behavior is well-defined for each state.
- **Maintainability**: Code becomes easier to read and modify.
- **Flexibility**: States and transitions can be changed or extended without affecting unrelated parts of the system.

#### Pros of State Machines:
- **Clarity and Organization**: Code for each state is modular and easier to manage.
- **Extensibility**: Adding new states or transitions is straightforward.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Helps to simplify complex, event-driven systems.

#### Cons of State Machines:
- **Scalability Issues**: Large systems with many states can become difficult to manage if not structured properly.
- **Overhead**: Some methods of state management (like stacks or tables) can introduce additional computational overhead in constrained environments.

### Methods of Implementing State Machines

There are three common methods for implementing state machines in embedded systems:

1. **Switch-Case State Machine**:
   - States are handled by a `switch-case` statement, where each `case` represents a state. This is simple to implement but becomes harder to manage as the number of states grows.

2. **Table of Function Pointers**:
   - States are mapped to a **table of function pointers**. Each state is a function, and the next state is invoked via a pointer lookup. This improves modularity and scalability compared to `switch-case`.

3. **Stack-Based State Machine** (Used in this Task):
   - States are stored in a **stack**, allowing for state transitions where the current state can be "pushed" and later "popped" when returning to the previous state. This is particularly useful for handling nested states or temporary states, like an emergency mode in a traffic light system.

   In this task, we use the stack-based approach to allow for dynamic transitions and to manage states like the emergency mode, where the current traffic light state is temporarily overridden.

### Stack-Based State Machine Traffic Light Controller on AVR

This project demonstrates a traffic light controller using a **stack-based state machine** on an AVR microcontroller, where state transitions (like switching lights) are managed using a stack of function pointers. The system includes 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green), and a button to trigger an emergency mode. A **timer interrupt** manages the regular state transitions, while the **external interrupt** is used for emergency mode.

#### Key Components

- **Stack-Based State Machine**: A state machine where states are managed as function pointers, pushed and popped from a stack.
- **Timer Interrupt**: Handles the regular state transitions for the traffic lights at fixed intervals.
- **External Interrupt**: A button press triggers the emergency mode, which interrupts normal operation and makes the LEDs blink.
- **LED Blinking**: In emergency mode, the LEDs blink for 3 seconds then transate to red stete.
